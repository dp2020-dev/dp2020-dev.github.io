<why look at data testing>

[The Complete dbt (Data Build Tool) Bootcamp:](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-dbt-data-build-tool-bootcamp-zero-to-hero-learn-dbt)

This course covers the theory and practical application of a data project using snowflake as the data warehouse, and the open source version of dbt. What was particularly relevant for a tester are the sections covering dbt expectations<add link>.

In terms of the course itself and the exam, it has a thorough self learning path which along with the self practice exam is all you really need, but I can also definitely recommend [John Savill's AI-900 - Azure AI Fundamentals Study Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9aarWMLJw0) as a practical summary.
